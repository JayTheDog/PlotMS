# PlotMS for QCxMS

**Plot** **M**ass **S**pectra (PlotMS) plotting program for the QCxMS program. 

**Installation**

Put the `plotms` [executable](https://github.com/qcxms/PlotMS/releases) into your `$HOME/bin/` folder. 
Put the *mass_raw.agr* file into your *$HOME* folder. 

**Running the script**

The files *qcxms.res* and *qcxms_cid.res* are produced then QCxMS is finished with the last run. Run `plotms` in your working directory. This produces the *mass.agr* file in the XMGRACE format. At the bottom of this file, the *m/z* and the abundances values can be found. 

For the older QCEIMS program, use plotms version 4.2
